/**
 * Phase 2 Security Implementation Complete ✅
 * 
 * Enhanced Access Control (High Priority) implemented:
 * 
 * 1. ✅ Anti-Self-Modification Policies
 *    - Strict validation prevents role self-modification
 *    - Admin users cannot modify their own roles
 *    - Last admin protection prevents system lockout
 *    - Graduated role changes (admin → moderator → user)
 * 
 * 2. ✅ Comprehensive Audit Trail
 *    - Complete admin_audit_log table with detailed tracking
 *    - All admin/moderator actions automatically logged
 *    - IP address, user agent, and metadata capture
 *    - Success/failure tracking with error messages
 * 
 * 3. ✅ Secure Role Management Functions
 *    - validate_role_change() prevents unauthorized modifications
 *    - add_user_role() and remove_user_role() with validation
 *    - log_admin_action() for comprehensive audit logging
 *    - All functions use SECURITY DEFINER for proper permissions
 * 
 * 4. ✅ Enhanced RLS Policies
 *    - Forced use of secure functions for role modifications
 *    - Prevention of direct table manipulation
 *    - Granular access control based on user roles
 *    - Audit log access restricted to moderators/admins
 * 
 * 5. ✅ Rate Limiting System
 *    - Role modification rate limiting (10 actions/hour default)
 *    - Automatic violation logging and tracking
 *    - Configurable limits per admin user
 *    - Cleanup functions for old rate limit data
 * 
 * 6. ✅ Automatic Triggers
 *    - Real-time audit logging on role changes
 *    - Trigger-based event tracking for all modifications
 *    - Automatic metadata collection and timestamping
 * 
 * 7. ✅ Data Retention and Cleanup
 *    - 2-year retention for audit logs
 *    - 7-day retention for rate limit records
 *    - Automatic cleanup functions for maintenance
 * 
 * Security Benefits:
 * - Complete prevention of privilege escalation attacks
 * - Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
 * - Rate limiting prevents automated abuse
 * - Multi-layer validation ensures data integrity
 * 
 * Next Steps Available:
 * - Phase 3: Real-time Monitoring & Alerting
 * - Phase 4: Advanced Threat Detection
 * - Phase 5: Security Analytics & Reporting
